# Advent of Code – TypeScript Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a series of daily programming puzzles created each December by Eric Wastl.

I’m using **TypeScript** to solve the challenges as a way to practice algorithmic thinking, write clean code, and become more confident with types and JavaScript fundamentals.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills through daily challenges
- Build a habit of coding consistently
- Practice writing clean, readable, and type-safe code
- Explore TypeScript and functional patterns
- Document my learning process

## Repository Structure

Each year is in a separate folder. Inside, each day has its own folder with a `main.ts` file and optionally input data or notes.

Example:

```yaml
├── 2015
│   └── day01-not-quite-lisp
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── input.txt
│       ├── main.test.ts
│       └── main.ts
```

## How to Run a Solution

To run a specific solution using `ts-node`, use the following command:

```bash
npm run solve -- <year> <day>
```

Example
To run Day 1 of 2015:

```bash
npm run solve -- 2015 01
```
