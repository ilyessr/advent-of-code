## ðŸ§© Problem Summary

### Part 1 â€“ Santa's Solo Journey

Santa delivers presents on an **infinite 2D grid**.  
He starts at `(0, 0)` and follows a list of movement instructions:

- `^` â†’ north (+y)
- `v` â†’ south (â€“y)
- `>` â†’ east (+x)
- `<` â†’ west (â€“x)

At every step (including the starting point), Santa delivers one present to the house heâ€™s currently on.

We need to determine how many **unique houses** receive **at least one present**.

Example:  
`>` â†’ 2 houses  
`^>v<` â†’ 4 houses  
`^v^v^v^v^v` â†’ 2 houses (just two very lucky kids)

#### ðŸ§  My Approach (Part 1)

- Use a `Set<string>` to track visited house coordinates (`"x,y"`)
- Initialize position at `[0, 0]` and add it to the set
- For each move:
  - Update the position according to the symbol
  - Add the new position to the set
- Return the size of the set (number of unique houses)

### Part 2 â€“ Santa & Robo-Santa

Santa gets help from **Robo-Santa** ðŸ¤–.  
They both start at `(0, 0)` and take **turns** moving based on the same list of instructions.

Santa moves first, then Robo-Santa, and so on.

We need to find how many **unique houses** receive at least one present.

Example:  
`^v` â†’ 3 houses  
`^>v<` â†’ 3 houses  
`^v^v^v^v^v` â†’ 11 houses

#### ðŸ§  My Approach (Part 2)

- Use a single shared `Set<string>` for visited houses
- Loop through the input string, alternating moves:
  - Even index â†’ Santa moves
  - Odd index â†’ Robo-Santa moves
- After each move, store the position in the set
- Return the number of unique entries in the set

## âœ… What I Learned

- Using `Set<string>` is perfect for tracking unique positions
- Be careful with global state â€” always isolate logic inside functions
- Sorting and destructuring arrays helps simplify code readability
