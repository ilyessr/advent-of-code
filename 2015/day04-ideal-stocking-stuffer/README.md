# Day 04 â€“ The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

ðŸ“Œ [Link to the puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4)

## ðŸ§© Problem Summary

Santa needs help mining AdventCoins (like Bitcoin) to give as gifts.  
He must find an integer which, when appended to a secret key and hashed using MD5, produces a hash that starts with a certain number of zeroes.

- **Part 1**: Find the lowest positive number such that the MD5 hash of the secret key + number starts with **five zeroes**.
- **Part 2**: Same thing, but the hash must start with **six zeroes**.

## ðŸ§  My Approach

- I wrote a function that:
  1. Increments a candidate number from 0 upwards.
  2. Hashes `secretKey + candidate` using MD5.
  3. Checks if the hash starts with the required number of zeroes using `.startsWith("0".repeat(zeroCount))`.
  4. Returns the first valid number found.
- To avoid repeating logic, I made `zeroCount` a parameter so I could reuse the same function for part 1 and 2.

## âœ… What I Learned

- How to use Node's built-in `crypto` module to generate MD5 hashes.
- How to write parameterized functions to avoid code duplication between Part 1 and Part 2.
